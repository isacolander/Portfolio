          Agile methods was one of the first courses in my programme at IT Högskolan, and in this course we were given that task of working in Agile sprints. Which means we follow the principles of satisfying the customer early, through continuous delivery of value in sequential sprints.  </p>

            The assignment began with a group of classmates and I taking upon the role as newly-acquired UX-Designers for an energy company. Our tasks consisted of firstly, to participate in a seminar to discuss pros and cons regarding the traditional waterfall- and agile development strategiy. Secondly, before starting our work in the five sprints, we were to appoint a Scrum master, plan in daily standups and preparing our work in a Trello board with a product backlog and DoD list. <br>
            <br>
            Every sprint also ended with a retrospective of what went well, what could have gone better and what can we do better next sprint. Additionally, A sprint demo and a meeting with the product owner to plan and access what to be done in the following sprint.<br>

          The first sprint consisted of us bringing fourth an evaluation of a competitors design. The evaluation needed to underline if there is any difficulty finding information, comparing prices or signing agreements. Our findings then needed to be turned into use cases and user stories.
          Below is screenshots of how our process looked while we worked in the collaborative interface tool Figma for sprint 2. We decided to divide the tasks and assign every person in our group with user stories to design. The goal was to construct basic wireframes to meet the requirement of every user case. <br>
          <br>
          (1.) The user stories I was given to design were as following; <i> <b> “As a new customer I need to able to compare Elbolaget AB’s prices to my own in order to see if I can get cheaper energy” </i> </b> and <b> <i> “As a new customer, I would like to know the competitors price of electricity without having access to my electricity bill.” </i> </b> (2.) Our finished work in sprint 2.

            Sprint 3 amounted us to firstly, create prototypes of the set user stories in desktop and mobile view, continue appointing scrum masters, holding in daily standups and phrase a list of definitions of done. For Sprint 4 our job was to continue working with emphasis on agile methods and improve on the designed prototypes with continous value. Lastly, for sprint 5 we organized the design document, made suggestions as how to improve the designs and what we would have done differently. We also were given a design system with colors, typography, buttons and so on, to use whilst further developing the prototypes of the desktop and mobile view in Figma. The assignment ended with my group and I having a final presentation of our work for our classmates and teacher.

          <div class="surveyheader"> 3. What I learned, Mistakes and what would I do differently. </div>
          I learned so much from this course, the agile methodologies, scrum, Lean-UX, MVPs and Design-Thinking were all super interesting to learn about and apply to our work. The assignment really felt rewardning and I immediately applied the new knowledge to other projects I was working on. <br>
          <br>
          Since I finished this course, I have completed: Business Benefits Of Design, User-Centered Design and Userinterface and prototyping at IT Högskolan. Therefore, I would say that If I were to redo this assignment I would appreciate and understand the assignment much more. I had never heard of scrum, trello boards, definition of done and agile methods before, thus I found the assignment to be difficult. <br>
          <br>
          Regarding my design choices, I consider my self to have a better understanding of what works and what does not now. And if I was uncertain, I would use UXR to make informed desicions. I would also implement usability testing to gather quantitative or qualitative information which then can be applied to the design to deliver an iterative, valuable and "cheap" product.
