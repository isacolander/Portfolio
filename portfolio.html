          <div class="casetext"> <b> This case study aims to showcase an in-depth examination of my progress from not knowing anything about personas to receiving an assignment consisting of the task to create one with a group of classmates from my university. This study will also thoroughly explain my initial thoughts, what I did not know before I started this project, things I could have done better and what I have learned.

          As previously mentioned, this particular persona was part of a group assignment three of my classmates and I were given. The assignment was to take on the role of UX-consultants for Willys AB and give them a persona which targets the audience of students, aged 20 to 30.

          Our job was to construct- and send out surveys, conduct interviews and compile the collected information and material in a persona that best portrays the target audience. We were also to present the persona to Willys ABâ€™s business developers and chairpersons, In other words, our teacher.

          I had some understanding that surveys, interviews and other information gathering techniques were used when developing, designing or improving a product, but I never knew what vast importance they held.

          UX Research was very new to me, hence Quantitative- and Qualitative methods like interviews, persona building, journey mapping, usability testing and surveys were so interesting to learn about and try out.
