          This case study aims to showcase an in-depth examination of my progress from not knowing anything about personas to receiving an assignment of creating one with a group of classmates from IT Högskolan. <br>
          <br>
          This study will also thoroughly explain my initial thoughts, what I did not know before I started this project, things I could have done better and what I have learned. </p>

          This persona was part of a group assignment three of my classmates and I were given. Our job was to take on the role as UX-consultants for Willys AB and construct- and send out surveys, conduct interviews, and compile the collected information and material in a persona that aims to best portray the target audience of students, aged 20 to 30. <br>
          <br>
          The goal of the persona was to portray the target audience's goals, needs and behaviours and evoke empathy in the beholder. To achieve this, we strived towards making it seem as if Alma was a real person and not just statistics and behaviors.

          Now, our assignment started with my group and I creating a google document and giving each other some time to examine and read each other's surveys that we had just created and sent out in a previous assignment. <br>
          <br>
          Thereon, my group and I put together a document where we helped each other phrase the questions and made sure we had a range of questions to collect all the information about the user we needed. For example, we made sure we had questions to help portray the target audience holistically. Such as shopping behaviors, frustrations and goals. We also had some different opinions on which questions the survey should consist of, so we decided to vote and discuss which to remove and which to let remain.

          <div class="surveyheader"> 2. Conducting the interview. </div>
          Afterwards, the survey answers were compiled in Google Sheets where we examined and coded important findings such as values, behaviours, goals, frustrations. This quantitative information about the target audience is super useful in creating our persona. <br>
          <br>
          After sending out our surveys and compiling the data, we started working on our interviews.  My group and I decided to create an interview template to follow so that our interview results are accurate and dependable. <br>
          <br>
          We built a semi-structured interview template which had four different sections; an Introduction, some fixed questions, a general part and lastly, an outro. This means that some of the acquired information will be quantitative and other qualitative. We also recorded the interview so that we didn't need to transcribe the interview on the spot, and instead be able to do so afterwards.

          <div class="surveyheader"> 3. Compiling the gathered information </div>
          After the interviews were conducted, we started compiling the gathered information. This process consisted of transcribing our interviews, coding the text and assembling it in a summative list. We searched for and underlined similarities, differences and patterns in aspects such as thoughts, experiences, shopping behaviors, attributes and other core values essential for the persona. Thereafter we started working on designing and creating in Figma. <br>
          <br>
          We had a pre-established template of what our persona needed to consist of provided by our teacher, and we chose to use a free persona template by the Figma team. Next we started constructing our persona and discussed which attributes, goals, behaviors and frustrations that best portrays the targeted audience. Thereafter, our persona was finished and we had a presentation of the finished assignment to our teacher and class.

          <div class="surveyheader"> 3. What I learned, Mistakes and what would I do differently. </div>
          UX Research was very new to me, hence Quantitative- and Qualitative methods such as interviews, persona building, journey mapping, usability testing and creating surveys has been extremely interesting to learn about. it has been super fun to apply the methods and activities of interviewing and sending surveys in practice.
          <br>
          <br>
          The previous survey we did before this assignment was instrumental for me, there were a thousand things I could have done better. For instance, I did not have a clear structure of the survey to make sure I was able to collect all necessary information. And, I had absolutely no previous experience of conducting interviews, thus different types of interview- and structure methodologies were very new to me and super interesting to learn about.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now what could I have done better, I made the decision to interview one of my closest friends and retrospectively, this was one of the many mistakes I made. Listening to, and transcribing the interview made me realize that if I had the chance to redo it, I would have chosen to interview a different person and ask the questions in a very different manner.
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, I did not know what I was looking to accomplish, specifically in the unstructured section of the interview. And I thereby did not conduct that part of the interview in a productive fashion. Shopping behaviors and online shopping regarding food were some of the key subjects that we aimed to gather nuanced insights of but I made little to no effort gathering such information, my follow-up questions and ability to come up with questions on-the-spot were simply not good enough.
          <br>
          <br>
          All in all, these are mistakes I definitely will learn from and they will without a doubt act as important eruditions to consider before I conduct any future qualitative or quantitative methods and activities of information gathering.
