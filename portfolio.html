            This case study aims to showcase an in-depth examination of my progress from not knowing anything about personas to receiving an assignment of creating one with a group of classmates from my university. This study will also thoroughly explain my initial thoughts, what I did not know before I started this project, things I could have done better and what I have learned.
          </p>

            As previously mentioned, this particular persona was part of a group assignment three of my classmates and I were given. The assignment was to take on the role of UX-consultants for Willys AB and give them a persona which targets the audience of students, aged 20 to 30.

            Our job was to construct- and send out surveys, conduct interviews, and compile the collected information and material in a persona that aims to best portray the target audience and evoke empathy in the chairpersons and business developers at Willys AB, in other words, our teacher. The goal of the persona was to try to make the persona a real person and not just statistics and behaviors.

            I had some understanding that surveys, interviews and other information gathering techniques were used when developing, designing or improving a product, but I never knew what vast importance they held.

            UX Research was very new to me, hence Quantitative- and Qualitative methods such as interviews, persona building, journey mapping, usability testing and surveys were extremely interesting to learn about and it was super fun to apply the newly acquired methods and activities on an assignment.

            Now, our assignment started with my group and I creating a google document and giving each other some time to examine and read each other's surveys that we had just created and sent out in a previous assignment. This previous survey assignment was instrumental for me, I had never done anything similar before and there were a thousand things I could have done better. For instance, the first time around I did not have a clear structure of the survey to help me make sure I was able to receive all necessary information.

            After learning from previous mistakes, my group and I put together a document where we helped each other phrase the questions and made sure we had a range of questions to collect all the information about the user we needed. For example, we made sure we had questions to help portray the target audience holistically. Such as shopping behaviors, frustrations and goals. We also had some different opinions on which questions the survey should consist of, so we decided to vote and discuss which questions to remove and which to let remain.
