          This persona was part of a group assignment three of my classmates and I were given. The assignment was to take on the role of UX-consultants for Willys AB and give them a persona which targets the audience of students, aged 20 to 30. Our job was to construct- and send out surveys, conduct interviews, and compile the collected information and material in a persona that aims to best portray the target audience and evoke empathy in the beholder. The goal of the persona was to try and make it seem as if Alma was a real person and not just statistics and behaviors. <br>
          <br>
          UX Research was very new to me, hence Quantitative- and Qualitative methods such as interviews, persona building, journey mapping, usability testing and surveys were extremely interesting to learn about and it was super fun to apply the newly acquired methods and activities in practice </p>

          <div class="surveyheader"> 1. Constructing the survey. </div>
          Now, our assignment started with my group and I creating a google document and giving each other some time to examine and read each other's surveys that we had just created and sent out in a previous assignment. This previous survey assignment was instrumental for me, I had never done anything similar before and there were a thousand things I could have done better. For instance, the first time around I did not have a clear structure of the survey to help me make sure I was able to receive all necessary information. <br>
          <br>
          After learning from previous mistakes, my group and I put together a document where we helped each other phrase the questions and made sure we had a range of questions to collect all the information about the user we needed. For example, we made sure we had questions to help portray the target audience holistically. Such as shopping behaviors, frustrations and goals. We also had some different opinions on which questions the survey should consist of, so we decided to vote and discuss which questions to remove and which to let remain.

          <div class="surveyheader"> 2. Conducting the interview. </div>
          After sending out our surveys we started working on our interviews. I had absolutely no previous experience of conducting interviews, thus different types of interviews and structure methodologies were very new to me. My group and I decided to create an interview template to follow whilst directing our interviews so that our results do not vary too much. <br>
          <br>
          We built a semi-structured interview template which had four different sections; an Introduction, some fixed questions, general part and an outro. This means that some of the acquired information will be quantitative and other qualitative. I also recorded the interview so that I didn't need to transcribe the interview on the spot, and instead be able to do so afterwards. <br>
          <br>
          I made the decision to interview one of my closest friends and retrospectively, this was one of the many mistakes I made. Looking back, listening and transcribing the interview made me realize that if I had the chance to redo it, I would have chosen to interview a different person and ask the questions in a very different manner <br>
          <br>
          For example, I did not really know what I was looking to accomplish in the unstructured section of the interview and I thereby did not conduct that part of the interview in a productive fashion. Shopping behaviors and online shopping regarding food were some of the key subjects that we aimed to gather nuanced information about but I made little to no effort gathering such information, my follow-up questions and ability to come up with questions on-the-spot were simply not good enough. <br>
          <br>
          All in all, these are mistakes I definitely will learn from and they will without a doubt act as important things to consider before I conduct any future qualitative or quantitative methods and activities of information gathering.
