          <p id="summary">
          Chairs designed to withstand the test of time, through thick and thin, rough conditions and still be standing on their one or many legs, definately deserves standing ovations. This case study will showcase of I designed an art curation of chairs. </p>

        <div id="pretext">
          <p id="prepara">
          This curation of furtniture is not apart of any of my courses, it is instead just one of the many different design projects I have been working on in the vector graphics editor tool Figma.<br>
            <br>
            I knew I wanted to design a website that exhibits products, but I figured that a full on E-Com website is a larger task than what I had in mind.

            Oxford Languages defines a curation as <i> "the action or process of selecting, organizing, and looking after the items in a collection or exhibition." </i> <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, the reason why I specifically chose to display furniture is because I was heavily inspired by posts of furniture brands I came across on my instagram, such as Pedrali and Falk. That said, this case study examines how I designed the curation of furniture, "Standing Ovations".

          <div class="surveyheader"> 1. Designing the desktop view. </div>
          I began the design process with the homepage depicted in the picture below (1.). I wanted the name of the curation to represent the purpose of the website and the appreciation of the selected items exhibited. Thereafter I started with wireframing and creating an early prototype in Figma. I designed the website top-to-bottom, with a made-up company name "BTT", and a super simple navigation system in the top right. <Br>
          <br>
          Next, I tried to find a way to creatively display the title of the curation whilst simultaneously letting the furniture items be in the center of attention, after some trial and error I came up with the design below (1.). My idea was to let the Pedrali chair divide the title, to give the design some depth and the impression that the item is being embraced by the title behind it. <br>
          <br>
          Now, after clicking one of the 3 furniture items on the homepage, the user navigates to a detailed view of the clicked element (2.). I had all the data, additional images, specifications, materials and dimensions of the chairs on their respective websites. As a result, my goal was to find a good solution of portraying the information about the chairs and I came up with the design depicted in the second screenshot provided below (2.). As for the Pedrali chair, I decided to divide the product information into three different sections, a general section which is displayed per default when the user first views the item, a section about its dimensions and lastly a materials section. <br>
          <BR>
          My thought process regarding the layout of the content is that I decided to put all the text elements such as; name of the product, a short description, the dimensions et cetera on the leftside whilst showcasing pictures of the chair and its variants on the right side. By doing so I seperate the images from the text like opposites on a spectrum (2.).

          <div class="surveyheader"> 2. Designing the mobile view. </div>
          After designing the homepage and selected item view in desktop, I also decided to design for the mobile user. Instead of designing the homepage again, I instead chose to design the list of currently exhibited items on the website (1.) and the interface after interacting with the list (2.).
          <br>
          <br>
          I wanted to strive towards designing a intuitive collection list and a solution to achieve this is that, by not fully displaying an even number of items in the list, the user immidiately and innately realize that the list is scrollable and most likely contains more items than what is currently visable and partly-visable (1.).
          <br>
          <br>
          Designing the interface of a selected item consisted of; Just like the desktop design, displaying the name and information about the product, figuring out the best way to portray the product, and sectioning the description and other detailed text elements into different sections. I decided to divide the generic information about the chair such as name and dimensions, and the detailed information about the chair with the use of the product images. By doing so I aim to let the user recognize structure and consequently helping them navigate and find their desired information about the product with ease (2.).
