          This curation of furtniture is not apart of any of my courses, it is instead just one of the many different design projects I have been working on in the vector graphics editor tool Figma.<br>
            <br>
            I knew I wanted to design a website that exhibits products, but I figured that a full on E-Com website is a larger task than what I had in mind.

            Oxford Languages defines a curation as <i> "the action or process of selecting, organizing, and looking after the items in a collection or exhibition." </i> <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, the reason why I specifically chose to display furniture is because I was heavily inspired by posts of furniture brands I came across on my instagram, such as Pedrali and Falk. That said, this case study examines how I designed the curation of furniture, "Standing Ovations".

          <div class="surveyheader"> 1. Designing the desktop view. </div>
          I began the design process with the homepage depicted in the picture below (1.). I wanted the name of the curation to represent the purpose of the website and the appreciation of the selected items exhibited. Thereafter I started with wireframing and creating an early prototype in Figma. I designed the website top-to-bottom, with a made-up company name "BTT", and a super simple navigation system in the top right. <Br>
          <br>
          Next, I tried to find a way to creatively display the title of the curation and came up with the design below.

          After sending out our surveys we started working on our interviews. I had absolutely no previous experience of conducting interviews, thus different types of interviews and structure methodologies were very new to me. My group and I decided to create an interview template to follow whilst directing our interviews so that our results do not vary too much. <br>
          <br>
          We built a semi-structured interview template which had four different sections; an Introduction, some fixed questions, general part and an outro. This means that some of the acquired information will be quantitative and other qualitative. I also recorded the interview so that I didn't need to transcribe the interview on the spot, and instead be able to do so afterwards. <br>
          <br>
          I made the decision to interview one of my closest friends and retrospectively, this was one of the many mistakes I made. Looking back, listening and transcribing the interview made me realize that if I had the chance to redo it, I would have chosen to interview a different person and ask the questions in a very different manner <br>
          <br>
          For example, I did not really know what I was looking to accomplish in the unstructured section of the interview and I thereby did not conduct that part of the interview in a productive fashion. Shopping behaviors and online shopping regarding food were some of the key subjects that we aimed to gather nuanced information about but I made little to no effort gathering such information, my follow-up questions and ability to come up with questions on-the-spot were simply not good enough. <br>
          <br>
          All in all, these are mistakes I definitely will learn from and they will without a doubt act as important things to consider before I conduct any future qualitative or quantitative methods and activities of information gathering.
