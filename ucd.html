    <p> I recently finished the course User-Centered Design at IT HÃ¶gskolan and this case study will examine and explain the one, and only assignment the course consisted of. </p>

    <p> The assignment my group and I were given was taking on the role of UX-Designers for Willys AB and conducting Usability Testing for their online shopping services, specifically with the targeted audience of students aged 20-30. </p>

    <em> *Note: Not the actual Willys AB, merely an excercise.* </em>

    <h4> Goal </h4>
    <p> Willys AB aims to become the leading swedish grocery store in online shopping with the target audience of students, aged 20 to 30. And to achieve this goal, Willys AB has asked Experience AB (3 of my classmates and I), to help them conduct Usability Testing for their website. This process was divided into four different segments. </p>

  <div id="part-1-text"> <h3> Part 1: Creating A Persona </h3>
    <p> Who are we designing for? A deep understanding of the target audience is crucial in designing and creating great products. </p>

    <p> The target audience summarized into a single individual, a realistic character, to evoke empathy in the reader and is based on collected data. This is a quintessential example of a great excercise, and I decided to dedicate the process of creating a persona its own case study. <a href="portfolio.html"> Read about it here! ðŸ”— </a> </p>

  <div id="part-2-text"> <h3> Part 2: Determining how to test and what to measure </h3>

    <p> Every user has its needs, and Alma Just as any other person, has the need of buying groceries, she needs to shop at grocery stores with a variety of foods and fast delivery. And she is a student after all, thus she needs good deals and prices. </p>

    <p> Our goal: with Willys AB's online services Alma can fulfill her needs. More specifically, design solutions, features and functions available to the user aims to help them achieve their needs, such as: a smart landing page with easily accessible deals and prices, the possiblity of viewing all the available items on the website and lastly, making sure Alma can find information about delivery and its costs. </p>

    <p> We decided to divide our test into three diifferent scenarios. Based on Whitney's 5E, The three different scenarios measures and tests different aspects and dimensions of the website's usability. </p>

    <p> We designed the three different scenarios to each measure one or more of the following usability aspects: Is the website error tolerant? Is it easy to learn? Is it efficient? And is it engaging? And to define any found problems we set some requirements!

    </p>

    <p> One of the three scenarios: </p>

    <h4> Scenario 1: </h4> <p> <em>  "You always eat oatmeal topped with banana every morning and for dinner you're thinking of cooking some traditional swedish meatballs, but you cant make it back from the store in time for class so you decide to order food from willys.se. <br>
    <br>
    Put 1 Oatmeal, 5 Bananas, 1KG Potatos, 1 package of meatballs and think out loud. and afterwards, fill in the survey of your experience." </em> </p>

  <p>Next-up, designing and sending out recruitment letters to testees, setting up a moderator's setlist and a test template and testscript. We also did 4 pilot tests internally to try out the designed test and find areas of improvement and some last key-insights before conduting them on real people. </p>

  <p> Next my group and I sent out rectruitment letters, found 4 testees that all fit into the target audience, scheduled digital meetings and sent out pre-texts of test and task descriptions, time and date. </p>

  <p> Thereon, we compiled the gathered tests into a list for analyzing, investigating and searching for key findings. Our test sessions were also recorded and live documented by an additional group member, this information was also accessed. We divided our qualitative- and quantitative data into two summative lists. </p>

    <p> The Quantitative list consisted of 5 columns and the data divided into individual rows depicting; Which scenario, what metrics we measured, What usability requirements we set, who we tested and the observed results. </p>

    <p> The Qualitative list was structured similarily, with 4 colums; Number, a short 3 sentence text of study findings, followed by what dimension of usability it can be categorized as. </p>

    <p> We also decided to design some infographics depicting the results and minimum requirements of completing each of the scenarios. </p>
